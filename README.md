# ZachC-Portfolio

Hello! my name is Zachary Cosby and this is my portfolio website! I am trying to better my coding, work on using git and github to host my projects, and become a better front-end developer

My goals for this project are to make a functioning website that shows off what I have accomplished during my coding endeavor, my resume, how well I can use git and github, and show off my use of JavaScript plus CSS to make this website look super cool

### The main pages of this project website are: 
1. About Me
2. Projects I Have Created
3. Contact Information for Myself

## Page Descriptions

The About Me page will include several CSS animations, as well as a interactive JavaScript feature

The Projects page will include a brief list of all of my most notable coding projects

The Contact Me page will include all of my contact information and how best to get ahold of me
